The average person checks their email <strong>23 times</strong> per day, and open up our email clients (ie. outlook) <strong>every 10 minutes</strong> to check for new emails. Now imagine a person coming to your desk every 10 minutes, to notify you that you have an email. Wouldn’t you find this troublesome? But we accept it<u>because it's email.</u><br></p><p>How many unread emails do you have in your inbox? The average person will receive <strong>10 - 75 emails</strong> per day, and depending your role some receive up to 200 emails per day. This also adds pressure to our every day routine.<br></p><p>Surely, email is an important task of our daily lives, however it is also one of the <strong>greatest productivity killers</strong>.

And thus effective management of our emails is highly important.<br>How many times have you been focused on a task, then <strong>disrupted by an email?</strong><br>You receive a notification of an email; you check it, and once returning to your task, you find that you have lost your focus. This is a clear example of how <strong>email kills your productivity</strong>.<br></p><p>Are you addicted to your inbox? do you feel that you need to constantly check your email? This is another reason why email kills your productivity.<br></p><p>We should always remember that email is only one method of communication, and if it is an urgent matter, people will usually pick up the phone to call you. Remember what your job is, and that checking email is not always our top priority, rather our task at hand.</p><ol><li><b>Set Outlook to open in Calendar, rather than email.</b><br>You come into work an open up open up Outlook, and you see you’ve already received 20+ emails which you need to traverse through, before being able to begin your work for the morning. <b>This creates stress in our work environment.</b> Rather let’s begin our day, by opening up Outlook in Calendar to show us what we have coming up for the day, as well as to make us feel<u>we are in control</u>of our day.<br><br>With Outlook open, go to <b>File</b> (Orange button in the top left hand corner).<br><img src=outlook-screen.jpg class=img-thumbnail> Select <b>Options</b> (second from the bottom), to open up the <b>Outlook Options</b> window.<br>Select <b>Advanced</b>, then in <b>Outlook start and exit</b>.<br><img src=options-pane.jpg class=img-thumbnail> Click the <b>browse</b> button, which will open up a<b<select>window and from here select <b>Calendar.</b><br><img src=options-calendar.jpg class=img-thumbnail> Press <b>ok</b> to close the Select Folder, and click <b>ok</b> againto close the <b>Outlook Options</b> window.<br>Restart <b>Outlook</b> to show reflected changes.<br><br></b<select></li><li><b>Ensure your inbox is emptied every day.</b><br>In our <em>"Dream World"</em>, our inbox is organised; we have no further actions to take; we don’t have any unread emails. This allows us to <b>place priority</b> on what<u>we want to read</u>first. So make it<u>routine</u>to clean up your inbox at the end of your day, by setting aside 15 minutes to give you time to clean up your inbox. Keeping in mind that a cluttered inbox, will only <b>add more stress</b> to our workday.<br><br></li><li><b>Turn off email notifications.</b><br>As we mentioned earlier, we spend lots of time to check our email, and we should not be distracted each time we receive an email. Also having a notification means that, we can not leave the email untouched and must proceed to check it. Causing us to leave our task at hand. However, this does not mean we should ignore email all together. In order to optimise our productivity, we should clearly specifiy some time to check our emails. See next section.<br><br>With Outlook open, go to <b>File</b> (Orange button in the top left hand corner).<br>Select <b>Mail</b> (second from the top), to show options regarding your email.<br>Scroll down to show <b>Message arrival</b> and ensure that all boxes are<u>unticked</u>.<br>Click <b>Ok</b> to close <b>Outloook options</b> window.<br><img src=disable-notifications.jpg class=img-thumbnail> Restart <b>Outlook</b> to ensure email notifications are disabled.<br><br></li><li><b>Set time to check email.</b><br>We neeed to be in <b>control</b> of when we <b>check our email.</b> With notifications for emails disabled. Block out time in your calendar to deal with email. If you miss the appointment to check your email, it means you were doing something <b>more important</b> than checking your email. <img src=sample-calendar.jpg class=img-thumbnail><br><br></li><li><b>Handle an email only once, don’t say <em>later.</em></b><br>Otherwise when <em>later</em> comes, we will probably say later again. Causing us to deal with (read) a particular email up to 10 times, and all this time the email remains in our inbox. Think of how much time has gone by<u>reading the same email 10 times.</u><br><br></li><li><b>Follow the rule of 4D's.</b><br>Aim to apply one of the following actions each time you open an email<br><ul class="list-links list-links--primary" id=fourD-list><li class=list_item><a>Delegate it</a><br>If the email is not directed to you, but it is for a colleague/ manager. You can easily create a quick action to forward an email to a colleague/ manager with the subject line FYI. Set a time of 5min, to give us some lee-way if after we press send, we feel that the email was not for them.<br><br></li><li class=list_item><a>Delete it</a><br>If the email is not directed to you<br><br></li><li class=list_item><a>Do it now (Deal with it now)</a><br>If the required action is quick (less than) 5min, or delete or archive the email<br><br></li><li class=list_item><a>Decide when to do it</a><br>An email can sometimes be turned it into a task and check when you have time the next following days and book time in our calendar for this. This also provides us with good proof of our wontime management.<br><br></li></ul></li></ol></div><h2>First time using Outlook</h2></main><div class=bottom></div><script src=scripts/main.min.js></script><script>
