Do this by:<br></p><ul><li>Navigate to <b>File</b> (located in the top left corner), and select <b>Manage Rules & Alerts</b>.

Click <b>Next</b> to continue.<br><img src=9-exceptions.jpg class=img-thumbnail></li><li>The final step before saving your rule, is to specify a name for this rule (something you can easily identify later, if need be), as well as selecting if the rule should be applied to existing items or only to new items. Click <b>Finish</b> to exit the <b>Rules Wizard</b>.<br><img src=10-name-rule.png class=img-thumbnail></li></ul><p>To ensure that all changes are saved, click on <b>Apply</b> in the bottom right hand corner, before selecting <b>OK.</b><br>The above procedure can be used and modified to create custom rules for you inbox; some further ideas are:</p><ul><li>Put emails from a specific recipient (ie. your manager), and mark with high priority</li><li>Put emails sent to a mailing list, or where you are not the direct recipient into a separate folder</li><li>Dealing with emails with a subject line (eg. forwarded emails)</li></ul><p>Custom Rules are able to be created directly from <b>Outlook Mail view.</b><br></p><img src=1-mailview.jpg class=img-thumbnail><p>When an email open, on the <b>top ribbon</b> you will see a <b>Move</b> category with the options <b>Move</b> and <b>Rules.</b><br>The <b>Move</b> option will allow you to <b>move or copy</b> the email you are currently reading to a <b>folder</b>, and also makes it easy to apply this moving/ copying action to all messages in the same conversation (the replies received to current email).<br><div class=center-content><img src=2a-move-option.jpg class=img-thumbnail><br></div></p><p>The <b>Rules</b> option will allow you to quickly create rules (as done above) with the specified recipient.<br></p><div class=center-content><img src=2b-rules-option.jpg class=img-thumbnail></div><p></p><p id=color-code-email><i class="icon icon-star tips-and-tricks-icon"></i><b>Colour code your emails.</b><br>Adding colour to specific emails will help you to identify certain emails at a galance. For example, we can create setting to mark emails received from our manager as they are recieved, a different colour in our inbox.</p><p id=quick-actions><i class="icon icon-star tips-and-tricks-icon"></i><b>Create quick actions.</b><br>Known as<u>Quick Steps</u>, are located on the top ribbon as part of the <b>Home</b> tab in,<u>Quick Steps</u>allows you to perform common actions with the click of a button or by pressing a specified short cut key (such as <b>CTRL+SHFT+1</b>).<br><div class=center-content><img src=1-menu-ribbon-location.jpg class=img-thumbnail></div></p><p>You will notice that there are some <b>Quick Steps</b> which are already present. <b>Mousing</b> over a specific<u>Quick Step</u>will provide you with more information on the specificed step, and the action which the particular step entails.</p><div class=center-content><img src=to-manager-qs.jpg class=img-thumbnail style="display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 141px;s"> <img src=create-new-qs.jpg class=img-thumbnail style="display: inline-block; width: 300px;"></div><p>If this is your first time interacting with<u>Quick Steps</u>and you <b>Click</b> on <b>To Manager</b>, you will receive the following dialog box to prompt you to enter and nominate and manager to be associated with this quick action.<br><div class=center-content><img src=1-first-time-setup.jpg class=img-thumbnail></div></p><p>In some cases, you may notice that there is a manager already nominated there (depending on your Outlook configuration). Ensure that your manager is listed correctly, and press <b>Save</b> to save this new quick step and to close the dialog.</p><p>So what if we want to do more than forward emails to our manager? For example; a common scenario is when we want to forward emails to a particular team or co-worker with the body "FYI see the email below". Creating a quick step makes it easy to perform this action in just one step. In the <b>Ribbon</b> ensure that you are on the <b>Home</b> tab and select <b>Create New</b> to create a new quick step. A dialog of the following will pop up:</p><div class=center-content><img src=2-new-quick-step.jpg class=img-thumbnail></div><p>You will need to specify a <b>Name</b> to idenitfy<u>this quick step.</u>An <b>Action</b> associated with this quick step will also need to be selected from the <b>drop down menu.</b> In this example; as we wish to<u>forward the email</u>we will need to scroll down the list of available actions to <b>select Forward.</b><br><br>In the <b>To:</b> field enter the name of a colleague/ alias for a team which you wish the quick action to be assoicated with. If you want the quick action to be associated with multiple actions, you can do this by <b>clicking</b> the <b>Add Action</b> button to add further actions to this quick step.<br><br>In our quick step, as we wish to add the text "FYI ... " to the email we will need to click on the <b>Show OptionsM</b> button below the<u>To</u>field.<br><div class=center-content><img src=4-add-options.jpg class=img-thumbnail></div></p><p>In the<u>Text</u>field, add additional text to be included in the message body. In our current example, we add the following text "FYI see email below Regards,". This is the text which will be added to the email with the current quick step. You are also able to set additional fields, including setting a<u>Flag</u>and<u>Importance</u>. We will also set the field<u>Automatically send after 1 minute delay.</u>This is an important field to consider when creating a quick actions, as after you perform the quick action - the email will not be sent automatically. For example; if after performing the quick action to forward the email to a colleague, we realise that the email contains some confidential information which we cannot share with our colleague. As this email will remain in our outbox for 1 minute, before it gets sent - it will give us some <em>"buffer time"</em> to undo our actions, in situations like we just described.<div class=center-content><img src=5-send-after-1-min-delay.jpg class=img-thumbnail></div></p><p>We can also add<u>Shortcut Key</u>to our quick action, this can be done by <b>selecting</b> one of the shortcut keys from the <b>dropdown</b> to associate with our quick action.<br>The<u>Tooltip text</u>refers to the text(description) which will be shown when you <b>mouse over the quick action</b>, as shown previously. In this example, we will set this to: "Forward the email to my team with body line: "FYI see email below".".<div class=center-content><img src=3-quickstep-shortcut-key.jpg class=img-thumbnail></div></p><p>Click <b>Finish</b> once you are happy with the specified settings in the quick step dialog, and this will close the dialog window. You will notice that your new quick step will appear in the quick step ribbon.<br><div class=center-content><img src=6-new-sq-compelte.jpg class=img-thumbnail></div></p><p></p><p></p><p id=english-calendar><i class="icon icon-star tips-and-tricks-icon"></i><b>Create calendar entries in<u>English.</u></b><br>Yes, <b>Outlook calendar</b> understands English too.

And thus effective management of our emails is highly important.<br>How many times have you been focused on a task, then <strong>disrupted by an email?</strong><br>You receive a notification of an email; you check it, and once returning to your task, you find that you have lost your focus. This is a clear example of how <strong>email kills your productivity</strong>.<br></p><p>Are you addicted to your inbox? do you feel that you need to constantly check your email? This is another reason why email kills your productivity.<br></p><p>We should always remember that email is only one method of communication, and if it is an urgent matter, people will usually pick up the phone to call you. Remember what your job is, and that checking email is not always our top priority, rather our task at hand.</p><ol><li><b>Set Outlook to open in Calendar, rather than email.</b><br>You come into work an open up open up Outlook, and you see you’ve already received 20+ emails which you need to traverse through, before being able to begin your work for the morning. <b>This creates stress in our work environment.</b> Rather let’s begin our day, by opening up Outlook in Calendar to show us what we have coming up for the day, as well as to make us feel<u>we are in control</u>of our day.<br><br>With Outlook open, go to <b>File</b> (Orange button in the top left hand corner).<br><img src=outlook-screen.jpg class=img-thumbnail> Select <b>Options</b> (second from the bottom), to open up the <b>Outlook Options</b> window.<br>Select <b>Advanced</b>, then in <b>Outlook start and exit</b>.<br><img src=options-pane.jpg class=img-thumbnail> Click the <b>browse</b> button, which will open up a<b<select>window and from here select <b>Calendar.</b><br><img src=options-calendar.jpg class=img-thumbnail> Press <b>ok</b> to close the Select Folder, and click <b>ok</b> againto close the <b>Outlook Options</b> window.<br>Restart <b>Outlook</b> to show reflected changes.<br><br></b<select></li><li><b>Ensure your inbox is emptied every day.</b><br>In our <em>"Dream World"</em>, our inbox is organised; we have no further actions to take; we don’t have any unread emails. This allows us to <b>place priority</b> on what<u>we want to read</u>first. So make it<u>routine</u>to clean up your inbox at the end of your day, by setting aside 15 minutes to give you time to clean up your inbox. Keeping in mind that a cluttered inbox, will only <b>add more stress</b> to our workday.<br><br></li><li><b>Turn off email notifications.</b><br>As we mentioned earlier, we spend lots of time to check our email, and we should not be distracted each time we receive an email. Also having a notification means that, we can not leave the email untouched and must proceed to check it. Causing us to leave our task at hand. However, this does not mean we should ignore email all together. In order to optimise our productivity, we should clearly specifiy some time to check our emails. See next section.<br><br>With Outlook open, go to <b>File</b> (Orange button in the top left hand corner).<br>Select <b>Mail</b> (second from the top), to show options regarding your email.<br>Scroll down to show <b>Message arrival</b> and ensure that all boxes are<u>unticked</u>.<br>Click <b>Ok</b> to close <b>Outloook options</b> window.<br><img src=disable-notifications.jpg class=img-thumbnail> Restart <b>Outlook</b> to ensure email notifications are disabled.<br><br></li><li><b>Set time to check email.</b><br>We neeed to be in <b>control</b> of when we <b>check our email.</b> With notifications for emails disabled. Block out time in your calendar to deal with email. If you miss the appointment to check your email, it means you were doing something <b>more important</b> than checking your email. Also remember to disable these notifications to check your email, otherwise we will be defeating the whole purpose of initially blocking out time in our calendar to check our email. <img src=sample-calendar.jpg class=img-thumbnail><br><br></li><li><b>Handle an email only once, don’t say <em>later.</em></b><br>Otherwise when <em>later</em> comes, we will probably say later again.
